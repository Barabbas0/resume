    <td><b>Massachusetts Citizens' Initiative Review Pilot Project</b></td>
    <td>August 2016</td>

Collaborated with nineteen other Massachusetts voters as a panelist on state pilot project to create a statement mailed to voters in advance of the November ballot. Over four days, panelists heard from a number of advocates and experts on a specific ballot question. As a diverse group, we had to work together to create consensus around a statement. At times, the group looked to me to moderate discussions with people up to seventy years my senior to maintain progress. I learned to operate in a ‘step-up, step-back’ process, and how co-experience and co-creation can lead to great transformations in understanding and discourse.
